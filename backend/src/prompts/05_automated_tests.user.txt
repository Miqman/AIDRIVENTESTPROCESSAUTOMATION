TEST CASES (JSON):
{test_cases_json}

Task:
Generate Playwright TypeScript test code for ALL test cases above.

Hard requirements:
- Output ONLY TypeScript code. Do NOT use markdown fences (no ```).
- Use @playwright/test and import from it.
- Implement EVERY test case in the JSON (no skipping, no “example only”).
- Each test case must map to exactly one test() block.
- Add a comment above each test() block with the test case id and title, e.g.:
  // TC-XXX: <title>
- Use describe() blocks to group tests (at least one describe()).
- Assume baseURL is already configured (use page.goto('/') or relative paths).
- Keep selectors and test data consistent with "test_data" fields when present.
- Do not invent additional test cases beyond the JSON.

Quality guidelines:
- Use stable locators when possible (getByRole / getByLabel / getByTestId), fallback to CSS if needed.
- Add minimal assertions that match "expected".
